Anyone who goes to Cambridge knows that cycling is actually very difficult, with those pesky tourists stepping out in front of you! Try and make it to the Computer Lab, hand in your supervision work (whilst avoiding various lecturers) and then make the journey back home to bed!

First get LÖVE:

# Installation Instructions

You can install LÖVE by downloading it from the [LÖVE homepage](https://love2d.org/) or by following the instructions below.

## Windows

Download the [32 bit zip](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.10.2-win32.zip), unzip it, and run `love.exe`.

You can also right-click on `love.exe` and create a shortcut for your desktop.

## Mac

Download [a zip containing LÖVE](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.10.2-macosx-x64.zip), unzip it, move the `love.app` file to the desktop and `Ctrl + Click` the file to run LÖVE.

## Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 - 17.10)

You can download love from the PPA

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install love
```

You will now be able to run LÖVE from the command line using `love`.

For other Linux/GNU systems, please refer to the [LÖVE homepage](https://love2d.org/).

# Creating a project

To create a LÖVE project, just create a folder with a single file in it called `main.lua`.

Drag this folder onto your LÖVE executable or run `love FOLDER_NAME` from the command line.
